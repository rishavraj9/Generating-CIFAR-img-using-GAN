# Generating-CIFAR-img-using-GAN

#Introduction
This project aims to generate synthetic images of the CIFAR dataset using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to create a system that can produce high-quality images that resemble the original CIFAR dataset, which is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
#Background
GANs are a type of deep learning model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic images, while the discriminator evaluates the generated images and tells the generator whether they are realistic or not. This process is repeated multiple times, allowing the generator to improve its performance over time.
#Methodology
Data Preparation
Data Collection: The CIFAR dataset is downloaded and preprocessed to ensure it is in the correct format for training the GAN.
Data Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the GAN.
Model Implementation
Generator: The generator is designed to create synthetic images by mapping a random noise vector to an image. This is achieved using a series of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers.
Discriminator: The discriminator is designed to evaluate the generated images and determine whether they are realistic or not. This is achieved using a series of convolutional and pooling layers.
Training: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously using a combination of the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
#Evaluation
Performance Metrics: The performance of the GAN is evaluated using metrics such as the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
Visual Evaluation: The generated images are visually inspected to ensure they are realistic and of high quality.
#Results
The results of this project demonstrate the ability of GANs to generate high-quality synthetic images that resemble the original CIFAR dataset.
